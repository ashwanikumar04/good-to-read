# How Frequently Does a Personalization Service Recommend Data in a News Feed App Using Elasticsearch?

In a news feed app like Inshorts, the **Personalization Service** plays a crucial role in delivering customized content to users based on their preferences, reading habits, and interaction history. When the content (news articles) is stored in **Elasticsearch**, the machine learning (ML) model determines how frequently the recommendations are updated and how articles are ranked to create a personalized feed. In this article, we’ll explore the various strategies for **recommendation frequency**, how these strategies integrate with Elasticsearch, and how real-time and batch updates can work together for optimal performance.

## Overview of Personalization Service with Elasticsearch

The **Personalization Service** uses machine learning models to recommend news articles to users. These recommendations are based on:
- **User Profile**: Preferences, interaction history (clicks, reads, likes), and explicit choices (e.g., topics followed).
- **Content Metadata**: Information about each article, such as category, publish date, and engagement (popularity).
- **Contextual Data**: Information such as time of day, location, and device type.

To support these functionalities, the service interacts with Elasticsearch to fetch and rank articles based on a **ranking formula**. This ranking formula considers multiple factors such as **relevance**, **recency**, **popularity**, **diversity**, and **context**.

## Frequency of Recommendations by the ML Model

### 1. **Real-Time Personalization**

**Frequency**: Every time the user opens the app or refreshes the feed.

- **Use Case**: For apps that need to provide real-time, highly personalized recommendations based on the user’s current behavior. This approach allows the system to recommend content dynamically based on the user’s most recent interactions.
  
- **Process**:
  - When a user interacts with content (e.g., clicking an article), the system updates the user profile in real-time.
  - Elasticsearch fetches new content based on updated user preferences and scores articles using the ranking formula.
  
- **Advantage**: Ensures that the user always sees the most relevant and up-to-date content.

### 2. **Batch Updates (Periodic Re-Scoring)**

**Frequency**: Periodically (e.g., every hour, or daily).

- **Use Case**: For platforms where real-time updates are not critical, batch updates can reduce computational costs. The system updates recommendations in batches, re-scoring articles periodically.

- **Process**:
  - At predefined intervals (e.g., every hour), the machine learning model updates user profiles and ranks articles.
  - Elasticsearch re-scores the content based on the latest model outputs, which are stored for use when users request the feed.

- **Advantage**: More efficient than real-time updates, especially for large-scale systems where users interact with the app less frequently.

### 3. **Hybrid Approach (Real-Time + Batch)**

**Frequency**: Real-time for critical interactions, batch updates for less critical events.

- **Use Case**: A balance between real-time and batch updates. Real-time recommendations are triggered for critical user actions (e.g., likes, article clicks), while batch updates are used for non-critical actions.

- **Process**:
  - Real-time updates are triggered when the user performs an important action, such as clicking an article, and the batch system updates less frequently (e.g., hourly or daily).
  
- **Advantage**: Optimizes system performance by only triggering real-time updates for important interactions, saving computational resources for less critical events.

### 4. **Content-Driven Updates**

**Frequency**: Whenever new content is published.

- **Use Case**: For apps where fresh content (e.g., breaking news) needs to be immediately recommended to users. Whenever new content is indexed in Elasticsearch, the system recalculates recommendations.

- **Process**:
  - Elasticsearch indexes the new articles.
  - The ML model is triggered to re-score articles for users, ensuring new content appears in the feed.
  
- **Advantage**: Ensures users always see the latest, most relevant content as soon as it is published.

### 5. **User Behavior-Driven Updates**

**Frequency**: Based on significant changes in user behavior.

- **Use Case**: When the system detects a substantial change in the user’s behavior (e.g., a sudden shift in interests), the model updates recommendations more frequently.

- **Process**:
  - Elasticsearch fetches new articles and re-applies the ranking formula based on the updated user behavior.
  
- **Advantage**: Helps adapt quickly to changes in user preferences, ensuring that recommendations remain relevant.

## Applying the Ranking Formula in Elasticsearch

In Elasticsearch, the **ranking formula** is applied using the **`function_score`** query, which allows for flexible scoring based on multiple factors. The ranking formula looks like this:

$$
\[
\text{Article Score} = \alpha_1 \times \text{Relevance} + \alpha_2 \times \text{Recency} + \alpha_3 \times \text{Popularity} + \alpha_4 \times \text{Diversity} + \alpha_5 \times \text{Context}
\]
$$

### Elasticsearch Query Components

1. **Relevance (User Preferences)**:
   - Use a **`terms`** query to match articles that align with the user's preferences (e.g., technology or sports):
   ```json
   {
     "terms": { "category": ["sports", "technology"] }
   }
   ```

2. **Recency**:
   - Use a **`gauss`** function to apply time decay, ensuring newer articles are ranked higher:
   ```json
   {
     "gauss": {
       "publish_date": {
         "origin": "now",
         "scale": "7d",
         "offset": "1d",
         "decay": 0.5
       }
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Popularity**:
   - Use a **`field_value_factor`** to boost articles based on their popularity:
   ```json
   {
     "field_value_factor": {
       "field": "popularity",
       "factor": 1.2,
       "modifier": "log1p",
       "missing": 1
     }
   }
   ```

4. **Diversity**:
   - You can adjust the scoring by encouraging diversity using **boosting** techniques.

5. **Context (Location, Time, etc.)**:
   - Context can be incorporated by applying boosts for time or location factors using **`boost_factor`**.

### Full Example Query

Here’s an example of how to implement the ranking formula in an Elasticsearch **`function_score`** query:

```json
{
  "query": {
    "function_score": {
      "query": {
        "bool": {
          "must": [
            {
              "terms": { "category": ["sports", "technology"] }
            },
            {
              "range": { "publish_date": { "gte": "now-7d/d" } }
            }
          ]
        }
      },
      "functions": [
        {
          "field_value_factor": {
            "field": "popularity",
            "factor": 1.2,
            "modifier": "log1p",
            "missing": 1
          }
        },
        {
          "gauss": {
            "publish_date": {
              "origin": "now",
              "scale": "7d",
              "offset": "1d",
              "decay": 0.5
            }
          }
        }
      ],
      "score_mode": "sum",
      "boost_mode": "multiply"
    }
  }
}
```

## Conclusion

The frequency at which data is

 recommended by the ML model in a news feed app like Inshorts depends on multiple factors such as the need for real-time personalization, the availability of new content, and user behavior. By using Elasticsearch and a flexible **ranking formula**, the Personalization Service can provide highly relevant and dynamic content that adapts to the user’s changing preferences and interactions. The system can use **real-time updates**, **batch updates**, or a **hybrid approach** to balance personalization and performance, ensuring an engaging experience for the user.
